### Udacity Nanodegree - Project--1 👨‍💻
### Landing Page.

Hi this is **Mohamed Shelf** 🙌 Udacity Nanodegree student.
This is my first project on FWD initiative 

*I edited the content a little bit to fit my point of view*

**Notes**
	1. Try to hover 'U' letter on Udacity name on the banner heading.
	2. Checkout the page responsiveness.
	3. This website is a very small - actually you can say a scratch because this is just for training - mockup for a teaching Company that teach web techs like CSS, JS.
	4. I converted the ES6 JS code that I wrote to ES5 using 'BABEL', and I saved the ES6 code in a file called ES6code in js folder.
have a nice time ❤
